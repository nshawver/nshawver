Hello! I'm Nick Shawver. I am an upcoming graduate from Liberty University, with a bachelor's degree in Information Technology: Web and Mobile Programming. I find joy in researching and creating new software solutions and specifically love to work with front-end development. I believe that this aspect of software development allows me to harness my creative mind and design beautiful pages and applications! If you would like to contact me, please do so by emailing me at nshawver18@gmail.com.
